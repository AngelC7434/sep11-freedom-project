# Entry 1
  When it comes to making a website, I'm not sure what topic I should choose since there are a lot of things that I'm personally
interested in. One particular thing that I am more interested in is the ocean. They cover most of Earth's surface and has been part
of our daily life for thousands of years. Every year, countless discoveries are being made, yet we still have a lot to learn about it.
Although I don't like going down into the waters myself, I am fascinated by what's underneath the water from pictures and videos that
I've seen online.
  However, as time progresses, and as we gain more knowledge of the bodies of water around us, we should also consider the damages that
have been done to them. Many still don't notice the effects humans have on these sea creatures. The ecosystems under the sea are out of
balance due to problems such as pollution. Small problems could become big ones and get out of control. Thousands and millions of species
call the place their home and many people can't live without it either. So we should spread awareness in hopes of greater changes for the
better.
  I am a student in the software engineering program (SEP) and I would like to take this opportunity to educate more people about how our
actions are affecting such a large part of our planet, and how we can change this. I want to take this chance to show how I use the skills
I'd learn in SEP and apply it to the real world.
